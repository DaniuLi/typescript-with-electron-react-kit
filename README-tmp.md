# Electron Starter

This is my own personal electron starter kit.

I will be bikeshedding with myself. I'm going to change my mind quite a bit.  You might prefer something more stable.

Still here?  Ok, let's do this.

# What's Inside?

**react**, **react-dom**

Can't imagine doing web differently to be honest. I'm sure we will soon, but for mid-2017, this is dominating.

**mobx**, **mobx-state-tree**, **mobx-react**

It brings the same things to the table as Redux, but with considerably less typing.

**ramda**

Lodash/fp is also a good choice here. I like ramda because I'm comfortable with it. `pipe` for life.

**typescript**, **tslint**

Such a well polished and wonderful typing system. I know this is a stepping stone to a better language, but JavaScript is really comfortable at this point. TypeScript dials the safety part in.

**fuse-box**

A fantastic bundler. 

WebPack always rubbed me wrong. Maybe it's the config? Maybe it's the way they name things? I'm not sure. What I do know is, once I started playing with FuseBox, I was sold. I like the devs behind this too.

**husky**, **lint-staged**, **prettier**

Some automation so I stop checking in crap looking code.

**ava**

This is my favourite testing framework. I've tried them all. The devs behind this are very talented, helpful, and friendly.

**npm-scripts-info**, **npm-run-all**

Quality-of-life utilities for npm.
